    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a great ground beef and spinach casserole. Even my husband, who
      doesn't care for spinach, likes this one! And it got rave reviews when I
      took it to a church potluck.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 (10 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>2 dashes hot pepper sauce, or more to taste</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
      <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of celery soup</li>
      <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions & Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ground beef, onion, and
        garlic; cook and stir in the hot skillet until beef is browned and
        crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add mushrooms,
        oregano, hot sauce, salt, and pepper; simmer for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add spinach, condensed soup, and sour cream; cook until heated through,
        about 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to a casserole dish and cover with
        mozzarella cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 15 to 20 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
